## Auto-Generated Documentation

This API reference is automatically generated from the TypeScript source code using TypeDoc. The documentation is kept in sync with the codebase through an automated process that preserves any custom content marked with the `locked: true` frontmatter tag.

For more information about the documentation synchronization process, see [README_LOCKED_DOCS.md](./README_LOCKED_DOCS.md).
